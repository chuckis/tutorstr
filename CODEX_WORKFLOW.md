# Codex Workflow

This project is designed to be developed with AI agents (Codex-style).

## How to create tasks
- Write tasks in GitHub Issue format
- Always include:
  - Context (files, folders)
  - Related spec section
  - Acceptance criteria

## How Codex should work
- Generate code directly into existing structure
- Do not refactor unrelated files
- Follow custom Nostr kinds exactly
- Prefer small, focused changes

## Example task types
- Implement feature from spec
- Generate React component
- Implement Nostr event builder
- Add relay handler
- Write documentation

## Definition of done
- Code compiles
- Feature matches spec
- No breaking changes
